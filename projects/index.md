Rhythm based super-casual game (ie. Timberman/Flappy Bird/etc.) Beats appear on a never-ending track that increases in speed over time.

Hit beats by tapping when crossing them! Track getting too fast? Slow down time by pressing on the left side of the screen, but be careful! You can only slow down time for so long... Play normally to regenerate the hourglass skill!

A game developed for Game Boy Advance where you play as a shopkeeper that has to make enough money each day in order to feed your family and get out of debt! Learn the best prices from the customers, pay attention to how they react to the items you're selling, and try to make the most profit possible!

Unity Mobile game in which you try to dodge blocks falling from the sky. Use the accelerometer to rotate side to side and stay alive for as long as possible!

## <a href="https://github.com/ajm11135/Restaurant">UGAHacks Restaurant Management App</a>

In my first hackathon I worked on the User Experience aspect of a restaurant management app in Android. We use Java for our backend and XML for the frontend development. I focused on the UX research and made certain changes based on psychology that I learned about through research on the restaurant business.
