Learn the best prices from the customers, pay attention to how they react to the items you're selling, and try to make the most profit possible!

In my first hackathon I worked on the User Experience aspect of a restaurant management app in Android. We use Java for our backend and XML for the frontend development. I focused on the UX research and made certain changes based on psychology that I learned about through research on the restaurant business.
