<center><b>Game Design</b> is my passion in life!</center>

## About

I'm a student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science concentrating in the creation of Media and Human-Computer Interaction.

Video games were an integral part of my childhood. Throughout my life I have always been infatuated with what makes a game addicting and fun to play. Now, I want to use my experience and education to go into a position working on User Experience. I have participated in HackGT and UGAHacks and have worked on the User Experience for both projects, designing specifically for the user.
